# Eat360

## Description
  Eat360 is a platform built around the concept of a social media network dedicated entirely to food recipes, with the added potential for monetization. Imagine a place where you can share your cherished household recipes, or showcase the culinary creations you've developed. This platform not only allows you to share your passion for cooking but also preserves these recipes, some of which have been passed down through generations. With Eat360, your family’s culinary legacy can be immortalized and shared with the world.
  
  So, dive in — <br />
    **Read, Cook, Eat, and Enjoy!**


<em>P.S. This is the first time I've done a project entirely on my own, so please forgive any code quality issues or bugs you may encounter.</em>
